txt2XML is a Perl/Tk program designed to transform semi-formatted
text files into XML according to a set of user-specified rules.
This program is targeted towards the bulk conversion of a set of
similar (but not identical) documents into XML. The original use-case
for this tool was to convert ASCII documents from scientific journals
into XML.

Please send any bug reports/patches/comments and suggestions
